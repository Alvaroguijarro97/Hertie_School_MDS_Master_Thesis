# Hertie_School_MDS_Master_Thesis
Repository for the creation of my Master Thesis at the Hertie School MDS Programm. 

Title: Predicting job creation in Colombian cities with key economic, social, and demographic information
Subtitle: Multivariate and univariate regression approach to job growth prediction

How to navigate this repository: 
Readings folder: Stores the readings used for research and referencing in the master thesis. 
PAP folder: Initial code of the PAP deliverable.
Master Thesis folder: folder containing the final master thesis document and pdf.
Datasets folder: Here is where the code and datasets are located
    - For each of the major datasets needed for the analysis, a unique folder was created that includes the original datasets, the R code used to preprocess and clean each one and the final excel file (Cities Indicators, Educacion Primaria y Secundaria, Fiscal Performance, Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares, IPC, Latitude and Longitude, Misc, Pobreza Monetaria, Pobreza Multidimensional, Population in Cities) 
    - A folder was created for storing the information needed to create the Colombian map in the Master Thesis in QGIS (Map of cities)
    - In the Cleaned Data Sets folder, all of the cleaned datasets were copied into this folder and here the final modeling code for each city was performed. There are some previous versions of the code stored there but the final ones used for the analysis are those that have the city name attached to it. 
    - A result folder was created to store each cities results in an excel format and their plot. Finally an excel file named Model Results contains all of the results stored in the same place and was were the result tables were created.
