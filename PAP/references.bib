En el proceso se utilizó un enfoque metodológico cuantitativo, de tipo descriptivo, para ello se emplearon datos de la Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares (GEIH), realizada por el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE), además de diversas fuentes referenciales de la literatura, donde los determinantes se catalogaron como cíclicos y acíclicos, dependiendo de su comportamiento, respecto al ciclo económico. Los análisis arrojan que Bogotá, Medellín, Manizales, Pereira y Cali, presentan las tasas de informalidad más bajas (entre 40 % y 50 %). Adicionalmente, entre las conclusiones resalta que existe una relación lineal o directa entre la duración del desempleo y la informalidad; a mayor tiempo en calidad de desempleado, mayor probabilidad de caer en la informalidad.English Abstract: The objective of this study is to identify the key drivers that explain labor informality in Colombia in the period from 2008 to 2017. A quantitative descriptive method was adopted to analyze data from the Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH) conducted by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) as well as several important sources in the literature. Drivers were classified into cyclic and acyclic, depending on their behavior with respect to the general economic cycle. The analysis revealed that Bogotá, Medellín, Manizales, Pereira, and Cali present the lowest rates of informal employment in the country (between 40% and 50%). Additionally, the most outstanding conclusion is that there is a linear or direct relationship between the length of unemployment and informality: the longer individuals are unemployed, the more likely they are to join the informal sector.}, number={3519297}, author={Berrio-Calle, Juan Esteban and Bran-Piedrahita, Lemy}, year={2018}, month=dec, language={en} }

It is thus important to explore the relationship between urbanization and employment. This study quantitatively analyzes spatiotemporal evolution and data correlation of urbanization and vulnerable employment, and explores the role urbanization plays in vulnerable employment by using historical data on 163 countries in the period 1991–2019 to test the theoretical hypothesis. The results show: It’s clearly observed that there is a high correlation between the rate of urbanization and that of vulnerable employment, and the examples of G7 and BRICs are for it. The estimated urbanization yields a negative and statistically significant regression coefficient (− 0.168), indicating that urbanization has a negative effect on vulnerable employment. If the urbanization rate increased by 1 %, the rate of vulnerable employment decreased by 0.168 %. The rural–urban sector conversion and changes in employment relationship driven by urbanization account for this. Countries with different income groups or populations have reacted differently to the rise in urbanization. Vulnerable employment in higher-income countries has been more significantly affected by the rise in urbanization, and more populous countries are more sensitive to it as well. These findings provide evidence for how urbanization promotes employment and decent work.}, journal={Cities}, author={Chen, Mingxing and Huang, Xinrong and Cheng, Jiafan and Tang, Zhipeng and Huang, Gengzhi}, year={2023}, month=apr, pages={104208}, language={en} }

To test the hypothesis of labor market segmentation, this document uses two methods of estimation: Switching Regression and Quantile Regression models. Results show evidence for the main propositions of the labor market segmentation theory; in particular, the results show that the values of an individual’s characteristics change significantly across the income distribution. The most important influential factor is university education.}, number={65}, journal={Revista Desarrollo y Sociedad}, author={Christian Manuel, Posso}, year={2010}, month=jan, pages={191–234}, language={es} }
 
 @article{Fernandez_Villar_2016, title={A Taxonomy of Colombia’s Informal Labor Market}, url={http://www.repository.fedesarrollo.org.co/handle/11445/3304}, abstractNote={A taxonomy of the informal labor market is extremely important to understand and handle informality, particularly in a country as Colombia where this phenomenon is large and heterogeneous. As we will argue in this paper, it is possible to identify four different types of informality, according to the reasons to be informal: low productivity of the worker
(subsistence informality), barriers to formality (induced informality), choice (voluntary informality) and both choice and low productivity (mixed informality). The policy recommendations to handle informality varies according to the target type of informality.  While induced informality might be reduced by the removal of formal employment barriers or by the implementation of active policies to reduce segregation in society, structural informality requires other kinds of policies, such as a focus on improving educational outcomes. Similarly, in the case of voluntary informality, providing economic incentives to formalize and controlling informality might be more effective, whereas mixed informality is more related to wrong incentives created by social benefits. In this paper we propose a methodology to identify the four types of informality to the case
of Colombia that follows what we did in Fernandez et al. (2016) but with greater emphasis on the education level. Although the correspondence is far from perfect, we show that in general terms, informal workers with primary education or less can be classified in the Subsistence informality group, informal workers with secondary education can be included in the Induced informality group, informal workers with tertiary education or more can be treated as Voluntary informal workers and informal workers with middle school education can cover mixed informality. Hence, the policy recommendations to handle informality among each education group are different.}, note={Accepted: 2016-11-17T19:16:07Z}, author={Fernández, Cristina and Villar, Leonardo}, year={2016}, month=nov, language={en} }
